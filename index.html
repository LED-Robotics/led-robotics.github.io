            <!--We are LED Robotics 6722, a passionate FIRST Robotics Competition
            (FRC) and VEX team based in Pasco County, Florida. Our dynamic group
            integrates engineering, programming, and teamwork to design and
            build innovative robots that tackle unique challenges each season.
            Beyond our technical pursuits, we are actively engaged in our
            community through events like Geared for Girls, which encourages
            young women to explore STEM careers, and the Trinity Farmers Market,
            where we share our enthusiasm for robotics with local residents.
            Additionally, we reach out to surrounding teams entering FRC,
            providing mentorship and support to help them navigate their own
            robotics journeys. Through our commitment to collaboration and
            community involvement, we strive to inspire others and foster a love
            for technology and teamwork.-->
            We are LED Robotics, Team 6722, a non-profit team of passionate engineers
            from Pasco County, Florida. We take part in both VEX competitions as well as the
            FIRST Robotics Competition. By training high school students in the fields of
            engineering such as designing, building, electrical and programming, we create
            unique robot designs to compete in each season's new engineering
            challenges and competitions. Beyond just the competition, we work alongside
            our local community through our Geared for Girls program, a way for us to
            inspire young women to join the STEM field. We make visits to
            the Trinity Farmers Market and similar markets to help inspire and teach children 
            about how robots work. As a local team, we support
            those around us through mentoring and support - both on and off the field.
            With our reliance on FIRST values, Gracious Professionalism, and Coopertiton,
            we hope to assist and inspire our <!--</p> <p style="margin-left: 51.5%;font-size: large;">-->community to make technology, robotics and
            engineering more accessible to anyone who wants to learn.
