            We are LED Robotics 6722, a passionate FIRST Robotics Competition
            (FRC) and VEX team based in Pasco County, Florida. Our dynamic group
            integrates engineering, programming, and teamwork to design and
            build innovative robots that tackle unique challenges each season.
            Beyond our technical pursuits, we are actively engaged in our
            community through events like Geared for Girls, which encourages
            young women to explore STEM careers, and the Trinity Farmers Market,
            where we share our enthusiasm for robotics with local residents.
            Additionally, we reach out to surrounding teams entering FRC,
            providing mentorship and support to help them navigate their own
            robotics journeys. Through our commitment to collaboration and
            community involvement, we strive to inspire others and foster a love
            for technology and teamwork.
